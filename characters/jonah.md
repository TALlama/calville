Jonah Meyer was Chancellor of UC Berkeley. He was killed by Axel Douglass in May of 1963.

## Background

Chancellor Meyer held his office for just over one year, from June 1961 to May 1963, but was at Cal for more than two decades, first as a student, then a professor. He met and married Ada Meyer while both were teaching at the school. His daughter Chava enrolled the year after his chancellorship began.

## Recent History

He was a hands-on Chancellor, personally approving the FBI's request to put Richard on campus to search for metahumans. He was concerned about increased unruliness on campus, especially the [love potion incident][s01e02] and the near riot that ensued. He [knew][s01e08] Eirwyn's background, but it is unclear why or what he did the last time she was here. Given Axel's connection to the death of the Yuan'ti King, it is likely that Jonah's knowledge might have been one reason for his death.
