## Background

## Recent History

He is a hands-on Chancellor, personally approving the FBI's request to put Richard on campus to search for metahumans. He's concerned about increased unruliness on campus, especially the [love potion incident][s01e02] and the near riot that ensued. He [knows][s01e08] Eirwyn's background, but it is unclear why or what he did the last time she was here.
