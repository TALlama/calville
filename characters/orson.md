Orson is a freshman at Cal, and a Nibelung Orphan who has the power to cloud mens' minds and make himself invisible, which he does so effortlessly that many people never notice him in the first place.

His adopted father is the millionaire Marcus Krieg, who seems rather disappointed in his son.

He was once [attacked][s01e01] by Jonathan Struthers, apparently because of their shared history in the Nibelung system, but Struthers' true motives– and his connection with Sam– remain murky.
