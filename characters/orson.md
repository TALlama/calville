Orson is a freshman at Cal, and a Nibelung Orphan who has the power to cloud mens' minds and make himself invisible, which he does so effortlessly that many people never notice him in the first place. He is somewhat concerned that his continued use of his powers is changing him, as he often later [regrets][s01e02] the actions he takes while invisible.

## Background

His adopted father is the millionaire Marcus Krieg, who often seems rather disappointed in his son. He sometimes [seems][s01e03] to be satisfied, but that may be Marcus using the boy… or perhaps preparing him.

He has been friends with Chava and her friend Bao since High School. Chava is his confidant with regard to his powers, and he is hers. Chava's ex-boyfriend Dick has taken a liking to Orson, and is often trying to rope him into social situations and other outings, despite Orson's complete lack of enthusiasm.

## Recent History

He was once [attacked][s01e01] by Jonathan Struthers, apparently because of their shared history in the Nibelung system, but Struthers' true motives– and his connection with Sam– remain murky.

When he was [caught][s01e07] trying to sneak into FBI HQ, his father was none too pleased. To get back in Marcus' good graces, Orson convinced his friends to take a [trip][s01e08] to Germany and find out more about his past.

## Powers

Orson can cloud mens' minds to wrap himself in the shadows, becoming invisible. When he does so he affects his "Hero Voice" to talk– a deep growl instead of his usual subdued mumbling. He also tends to lose himself in his "character", saying and doing things that he would never do when visible. He often wonders why this is, and how– and if– he can better control himself.
