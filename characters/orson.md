Orson is a freshman at Cal, and a Nibelung Orphan who has the power to cloud mens' minds and make himself invisible, which he does so effortlessly that many people never notice him in the first place. He is somewhat concerned that his continued use of his powers is changing him, as he often later [regrets][s01e02] the actions he takes while invisible.

His adopted father is the millionaire Marcus Krieg, who often seems rather disappointed in his son. He sometimes [seems][s01e03] to be satisfied, but that may be Marcus using the boy… or perhaps preparing him.

He was once [attacked][s01e01] by Jonathan Struthers, apparently because of their shared history in the Nibelung system, but Struthers' true motives– and his connection with Sam– remain murky.
