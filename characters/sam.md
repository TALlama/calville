Samantha "Sam" Smtih is aide-de-camp to Marcus Krieg, and does a variety of jobs in that capacity, up to and including [killing][s01e03] on his behalf.

Her twin brother Richard and her do not see eye to eye.

She was [aiding][s01e01] Jonathan Struthers with his vendetta against the Nibelung Orphans, but the nature, extent, and motivation of that aid remain murky. As she also led the search for Timothy Simmons, it seems that either her job or her personality are driving her toward metahumans.
