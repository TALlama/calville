Samantha "Sam" Smtih is aide-de-camp to Marcus Krieg, and does a variety of jobs in that capacity, up to and including [killing][s01e03] on his behalf.

Her twin brother Richard and her do not see eye to eye.

She was [aiding][s01e01] Jonathan Struthers with his vendetta against the Nibelung Orphans, but the nature, extent, and motivation of that aid remain murky. As she also led the [search][s01e03] for Timothy Simmons, it seems that either her job or her personality are driving her toward metahumans.
