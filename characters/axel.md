Axel Douglas is an ex-CIA agent who now works as an assassin for hire.

## Background

Axel's real parents were among the scientists that staffed the Nibelung Project during World War II, but they were killed and Axel was mistaken for one of the subjects when the Allies liberated the compound. He was adopted and raised by Rob Douglas, later following his father into government service, but his heart was never in it. He always knew that he was more than what people saw him as, and he worked hard to get the skills he would later use to strike out on his own.

## Recent History

It's unclear how he became connected to the Yuan'ti, but somehow Axel was hired by Prince Denali to help assassinate Denali's father, the King. It pained him to have to hurt Eirwyn to do so, but the payoff was enough that he took the job, and he managed to leave Eirwyn unaware of his involvement.

In the [spring of 1963][s1e11], Axel visited his father in San Francisco, but his real motive was another assassination, this time of UC Berkeley Chancellor Jonah Meyer. Again he had to evade Eirwyn to complete his task, but again he managed to escape without conclusive evidence that he was at fault.
