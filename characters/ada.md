Ada Meyer is a professor of clinical psychology at UC Berkeley, Chancellor Jonah Meyer's wife, and Chava Meyer's mother.

## Background

Professor Meyer has been teaching at Cal for many years, although in the past few years her duties as the Chancellor's wife have forced her to cut back on her larger classes and focus more on a few graduate students.
