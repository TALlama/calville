Richard is an undercover FBI agent on the lookout for metahumans, and he's finding more than he wants to. He is also the FBI's [newly-appointed][s01e03] special liaison officer to the Kriemhild Project.

He used to date Bao, but they [broke up][s01e02] some time ago, much to his consternation. His twin sister Sam Smith works for Marcus Kreig, although he finds the [tasks she performs][s01e03] to be rather distasteful.
