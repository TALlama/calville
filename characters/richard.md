Richard is an undercover FBI agent on the lookout for metahumans, and he's finding more than he wants to. He is also the FBI's [newly-appointed][s01e03] special liaison officer to the Kriemhild Project.

## Background

Richard and Sam are twins, but they do not see eye to eye. After a tragedy in their past, Richard joined the FBI, while Sam went to work for Marcus Kreig.

He used to date Bao, but they [broke up][s01e02] some time ago, much to his consternation.

## Recent History

He has captured [one confirmed][s01e01] metahuman: Jonathan Struthers, who used his contol of fire to attack Richard's friend Orson. His sister Sam [enlisted his help][s01e03] with another metahuman, Timothy Simmons, who had volunteered to become a super-soldier and instead became an abomination. When Marcus Kreig ordered him eliminated and Richard helped Sam to do so, Richard was brought into the Kriemhild Project as an asset.

His beat on campus also entwines him with [other][s01e02] matters of less import, as well as some of [great import][s01e04], but he remains focused on his core mission of finding metahumans.
