Richard is an undercover FBI agent on the lookout for metahumans, and he's finding more than he wants to. He is also the FBI's [newly-appointed][s01e03] special liaison officer to the Kriemhild Project, and the [designated][s01e07] handler for Eirwyn.

## Background

Richard and Sam are twins, but they do not see eye to eye. After a tragedy in their past, Richard joined the FBI, while Sam went to work for Marcus Kreig.

He used to date Bao, but they [broke up][s01e02] some time ago, much to his consternation.

## Recent History

He has captured [one confirmed][s01e01] metahuman: Jonathan Struthers, who used his contol of fire to attack Richard's friend Orson. His sister Sam [enlisted his help][s01e03] with another metahuman, Timothy Simmons, who had volunteered to become a super-soldier and instead became an abomination. When Marcus Kreig ordered him eliminated and Richard helped Sam to do so, Richard was brought into the Kriemhild Project as an asset. After being [alerted to her existence][s01e06], he now visits Timothy's daughter Anastasia Simmons somewhat regularly.

His beat on campus also entwines him with [other][s01e02] matters of less import, as well as some of [great import][s01e04], but he remains focused on his core mission of finding metahumans. After one too many close calls, Rob has provided Richard with a variety of surveilance mechanisms that should help him in the field.

He has become quite close to both Orson and Chava, and is very upset when they [get into harm's way][s01e04], and gets [especially upset][s01e05] when people like Dick push them into harms way. He remains unaware that his two closest friends are both metahumans, but does suspect that Orson is hiding something from him.

He has [pledged][s01e07] to help Eirwyn in whatever way he can.
