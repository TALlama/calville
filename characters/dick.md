Dick is a sophomore at Cal, but you wouldn't know it from talking to him. He spends most of his time at parties, often dragging Orson along. When he's not at parties he's usually with one of a number of student groups of rather questionable character, all of which he seems to belong to.

He dated Chava last year and still isn't over her. He fancies Orson as his best friend, but Orson would not describe their relationship in those terms.
