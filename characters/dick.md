Dick is a sophomore at Cal, but you wouldn't know it from talking to him. He spends most of his time at parties, often dragging Orson along. When he's not at parties he's usually with one of a number of student groups of rather questionable character, all of which he seems to belong to.

He has an on-again/off-again relationship with Chava, but since their last on-again stint was helped along by [a love potion][s01e02], he's unsure of where they stand at the moment. He fancies Orson as his best friend, but Orson would not describe their relationship in those terms.
