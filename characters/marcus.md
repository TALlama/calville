Marcus is an inventor and a millionaire many times over, and has used his wealth to great purpose. He is one of Cal's largest donors, and uses his considerable talents to consult with the local FBI.

Sam Smith is often at his side or tending to his many businesses, or wrapping up lose ends related to his FBI contracts, as when she helped [dispose][s01e03] of Timothy Simmons on Marcus' orders.

His son Orson is not what he had hoped, but his [recent escapades][s01e07] have made Marcus wonder what is really going on with his adopted son, and he has begun [experimenting][s01e08] to find out more.
