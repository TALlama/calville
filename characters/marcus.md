Marcus is an inventor and a millionaire many times over, and has used his wealth to great purpose. He is one of Cal's largest donors, and uses his considerable talents to consult with the local FBI.

Sam Smith is often at his side or tending to his many businesses. His son Orson is not what he had hoped.
