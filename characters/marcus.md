## Background

Marcus has long run the very profitable Krieg Industries.

He adopted an infant Orson through his miltary contacts.

## Recent History

Some time ago he hired Sam Smith, and she is often at his side or tending to his many businesses, as when she helped [dispose][s01e03] of Timothy Simmons on Marcus' orders.

When Orson was [caught][s01e07] sneaking into the FBI Headquarters for unknown reasons, Marcus began to wonder what was really going on with his adopted son. He [sent][s01e08] the lad to Germany to find out more, and ended up [recruiting][s01e09] Chava, either as a spy on his son or as a resource for some other endsâ€¦ or both.
