Chava is a freshman who recently found that she can see other peoples' memories. Discovering the source of these powers– her own and others she has met– has become her chief focus.

Her father Jonah Meyer is Cal's Chancellor, and before that was a professor at Cal, and before that a student there, so she has spent her entire life on and around the campus, and is quite familiar with its ins and outs. A child progidy, she's been sitting in on classes for many years, so it is unusual when someone doesn't know who she is.

She and her long-time friend Orson know of each others' powers. She [suspects][s01e03] that Sam and possibly Richard know about people with powers, but does not yet know what to do about the twins.

She dated Dick for a time in High School, broke it off when he began to experiment with the local radicals, but after rekindling their relationship with the aid of [a certain love potion][s01e02], she is reconsidering that decision.
