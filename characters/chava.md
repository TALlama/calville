Chava is a freshman who recently found that she can see other peoples' memories. Discovering the source of these powers– her own and others she has met– has become her chief focus.

## Background

Chava grew up at Cal, where her father was a professor. Having spent her entire life on and around the campus, she is quite familiar with its ins and outs. A child progidy, she's been sitting in on classes for many years, so it is unusual when someone doesn't know who she is.

In high school she met Bao, who became her best friend. She also met Orson, whose father was a Cal donor, and they became fast friends, bonding over their shared secret of powers and Cal. In her senior year of high school she dated Dick, who was already at Cal as a freshman. But when he began to experiment with the local radicals, she broke it off.

He father was elevated to the position of Chancellor at the start of the 1961 academic year, and she started classes in 1962.

## Recent History

After rekindling her relationship with Dick with the aid of [a certain love potion][s01e02], she is reconsidering her decision to break it off with him. She cannot deny her feelings for him, but finds him frustratingly lackadaisical, and his [connections][s01e04] to various shady characters have gotten her in trouble on multiple occasions.

Her own obsession with finding out the origin of powers gets her into trouble, as well, especially when [other people][s01e01] with powers cross her radar. She [suspects][s01e03] that Sam and possibly Richard know about people with powers, but does not yet know what to do about the twins.

## Powers

Chava is intimately connected to the memories of those around her. Other people's memories often intrude into her mind without her having to do anything. Although she has learned to block them out most of the time, she still sees some intense memories unbidden, especially when she is distracted or asleep. When she is near someone, a little focus allows her to reach out and inspect their memories without their knowledge. More recently, she has had to figure out how to [muddle][s01e03] the memories of others, which she has used to cover her tracks when she and Orson have been a little more obvious than she would like.
