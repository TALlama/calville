title: Timothy Simmons  

An army veteran who volunteered for the Kriemhild Project's super-soldier program. He had no family to speak of– save an estranged child born out of wedlock– and was chosen as the test subject. The project did indeed increase his physical abilities, but it also transformed his body into a hulking, scaled form that made the benefits useless for wider application. When Kriemhild decided to terminate the project– and the test subject– Simmons escaped. Marcus Krieg tasked Sam Smith with tracking Simmons down, and with the aid of her brother Richard she did so, then killed him, despite the interference of Chava and Orson.
